Changes made 
Home page changed images 
Logo removed the background and inserted it at the center and used CSS to modify the edges of the pictures. Changed the background of the entire website from white to pink and manipulated the navigation bar to be in line with a highlighting hover button.
Created a content container for submitting messages and orders, made the services page redirect the user to the contact us page when selecting a certain service and the logo picture when selecting it will lead to the home page.
